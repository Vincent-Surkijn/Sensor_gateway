# SysSoft Lab repo
This project was made for the course System Software at Group T, KU Leuven.
The goal was to make a multi-threaded, multi-process sensor gateway that could connect to sensors via TCP, save their values in a SQLite database and monitor extreme values.

I received a 18/20 for the final version.

I want to thank Yuri Cauwerts and Jeroen Van Aken for guiding me.
